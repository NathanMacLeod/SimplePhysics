# SimplePhysics
Tried to create a simple 2d physics engine. Made around December 2018

To interact with bodies use either the force tool, force drag tool, or linear drag tool, and click on the body and drag.
New bodies can be created using the rectangle tool, N-sided polygon tool, or custom polygon tool. Toggling the "create fixed polygon" button
will make newly created bodies with a fixed position and angle. To use the create custom polygon tool drag the mouse to create the desired shape and right click to finish it.
Bodies that are interlocking or some concave shapes tend to have buggy behavior.
